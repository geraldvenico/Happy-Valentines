                <p> 
                    <span>
                        &emsp; If someone had told me years ago that we would end up like this, I wouldn’t have believed them. You were my childhood friend, someone I never imagined would see me the way I saw you. Back then, I thought you would never like me the way I liked you... but life has a beautiful way of surprising us.

                        Now, here we are. Every day with you feels like a dream I never want to wake up from. Your laugh is my favorite melody, your beauty is something that leaves me speechless, and your love is the most precious gift I’ve ever received.
                    </span>
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp;  I still remember our first kiss in the cinema.... the moment that I would never forget. And when we got home that night, talking about Gojo, and how he carried the girl, I remember lifting you up just to make you laugh. That’s how "Gojo carry" became our thing, one of the many little memories that make our love special.

                        You have always been there for me, loving me in a way that’s more than just words. You show it in everything you do, and because of that, you’ve made my life so much better. But I also know that I’m not perfect.
                    </span> 
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp; I’m sorry, babiii. I know that sometimes we fight because of me. I know that sometimes I make you cry, and I hate myself for it. I never want to be the reason for your sadness. I just hope you won’t leave me because of my selfishness. I promise, I will do better. Next time, I will only make you cry because of joy.

                        I know I can be difficult to deal with sometimes, and for that, I’m really sorry. I’m also sorry for stopping you from wearing clothes that made me uncomfortable. That was wrong of me, and I won’t do that anymore. I will always support you and let you be yourself, because that’s the person I fell in love with—the strong, independent, and beautiful you.
                    </span>     
                    <br> <br>
                    <span>
                        &emsp; And about the 3 million I promised you before? Just wait, my babii. Maybe five years from now, you’ll have it. I’ll make sure of that.

                        Please, always be safe. Always carry a self-defense tool, and never let yourself go hungry. Eat whatever you like, but try to reduce your sweets, okay? I want you to be healthy because I want to be with you for a very long time.
                        
                        No matter what, I will always be here for you. I will always support you in everything you want to do. You are my love, my home, and my future, and I will never stop proving that to you.
                    </span>
